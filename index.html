# bread- corn bread
 Top Secret Recipes
  version of Chevys® Sweet Corn Tomalito by Todd Wilbur
   
    4 cups frozen corn, thawed
    1/3 cup butter, softened
    1/2 cup granulated sugar
   3/4 cup milk
    1/2 cup masa harina
    1/2 cup corn meal
    1/2 teaspoon baking powder
    1/2 teaspoon salt 	
  
  1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
  2. Cream softened butter together with sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add milk and masa and mix well.
  3. Use a blender or food processor to puree 2 cups of corn until smooth. Add pureed corn to butter/masa mixture and mix well. Add corn meal, baking powder, salt and remaining corn and mix until combined. 
  4. Pour mixture into an ungreased 8x8-inch baking pan. Cover with foil and place it into a 9x13-inch baking pan. Add hot water to the larger baking pan until it's about 1/3 full. Bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until corn cake is firm in the center. Let it sit covered for 10 minutes before serving. To serve, scoop out about a 1/2 cup portion with a large spoon.
  
  Makes 8 servings.
  
 Other Mexican food chains such as Chi-Chi's and El Torito call it "Sweet Corn Cake." But at Chevy's, the corn-filled, pudding-like stuff that's served with most entrees is known as "Tomalito." That masa harina in there (corn flour) is what's used to make tamales, and it can be found in your supermarket either with the corn meal and flour, or wherever the other Mexican/Spanish items are stocked. Everything else here is basic stuff. While other recipes for corn cake may require canned corn or canned cream-style corn, Chevys' "no cans in the kitchen" commandment requires that we use frozen corn for a proper clone. Of course, you may also use corn that's been cut fresh from the cob, if you're up for it. 

# bread- corn cakes-cheesecake factory
  Top Secret Recipes version of The Cheesecake Factory® Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes®  by Todd Wilbur 	

  
    Salsa Verde
    2 tomatillos, chopped (remove papery skin)
    1 4-ounce can mild green chilies
    1 green onion
    2 tablespoons fresh cilantro
    1 1/4 teaspoons granulated sugar
    1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
  
    Southwestern Sauce
    1/2 cup mayonnaise 
    1 teaspoon white vinegar
    1 teaspoon water
    3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar
    1/2 teaspoon chili powder
    1/4 teaspoon paprika
    1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
    1/8 teaspoon onion powder
    dash salt
    dash garlic powder
  
    Tomato Salsa
    1 medium tomato
    1 tablespoon minced Spanish onion
    1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, mince
    1/4 teaspoon lime juice
    1/2 small fresh jalapeno, minced
    dash salt
    dash ground black pepper
  
    Cakes
    1 1/2 cups frozen sweet corn
    1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened
    3 tablespoons granulated sugar
    1/8 teaspoon salt
    1/2 cup corn masa (corn flour)
    2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
  
    Garnish
    1/4 cup sour cream
    1/2 avocado, chopped
    2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, coarsely chopped 
    1. Prepare salsa verde by combining all ingredients (tomatillos, green chilies, green onion, cilantro, sugar, cumin, salt, and pepper) in a food processor on high speed. Cover and chill.
    2. Prepare tomato salsa by combining all ingredients (diced tomato, onion, cilantro, lime juice, jalapeno, salt, and pepper) in a small bowl. Cover and chill.
    3. Prepare southwestern sauce by combining all ingredients (mayonnaise, vinegar, water, sugar, chili powder, paprika, cayenne, onion powder, salt, and garlic powder) in a small bowl. Cover and chill.
   4. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
    5. Prepare the tamale cakes by chopping 1 cup of the frozen corn in a food processor until it's coarsely pureed. Combine pureed corn with softened butter, sugar, and salt. Blend well with electric mixer until smooth.
    6. Add masa and flour and blend well. Mix in the remaining 1/2 cup of frozen corn kernels by hand. 
    7. Measure 1/2 cup portions of the mixture and form it into 3-inch wide patties with your hands. arrange the patties on a baking sheet and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the cakes are browned on the bottom. Carefully flip all cakes with a spatula and bake for an additional 5 to 7 minutes or until other side is browned. 
    8. While the cakes are baking, spoon a portion of the salsa verde onto a plate or platter (you may want to heat up your plate in the oven for a bit to help warm the sauce). You'll need to use enough salsa verde to coat the entire plate -- it should be about 1/4-inch deep. Arrange the tamale cakes side-by-side on the salsa verde. Spoon a dollop of sour cream onto each tamale cake. Drizzle the southwestern sauce over the cakes in a criss-cross patter (use a squirt bottle if you've got one -- see "Tidbits"). Spoon some tomato salsa over the cakes, followed by the chopped avocado. Finish off the plate by sprinkling the coarsely chopped cilantro leaves over the top. 
  
  + Tidbits
  + Save your empty plastic mustard or ketchup bottles to use in recipes such as this one. Use the squirt bottle to drizzle the southwestern sauce over your dish to give it that slick professional look. And if you want to cut out some of the fat in the sauce, you can easily substitute light mayo for the regular stuff.
  + You'll find tomatillos in the produce section, usually near the tomatoes or peppers. Be sure to remove the papery skin before using them.
  + As for corn masa, or corn flour; you'll find that in the baking aisle by the other flours or where the Mexican foods are stocked.

  adjust it to your schedule. I have found that it is best to cook this the 
  day before you serve it. It is easier to slice when cold, the fat will 
  solidify, and you can remove it from the juice. Enjoy!

# candy- chocolae candy- joni
    1 large bag milk or semi sweet chips (or anything else for that matter)
    1 stick buttah (no substitutes)
    Noogies of your choice. 
  
  + My fav is nuts of any sort (cashews) and raisins! Any kind of TOASTED nut or coconut toasted or untoasted. Actually plain nuts are ok too and that's what I have put in the cashew raisin one; you can use pecans or walnuts. Dry roasted peanuts are good. I'm sure you could use toffee pieces : ) too, white chocolate, etc. 
  
  + All you do is melt the chips and buttah together and add the noogies. No magic. Then spoon them out on wax paper before it sets up in your pan. Fridge it to set it or not. Just get a spoon and enjoy!

# cookies- black and white
### from gourmet
      1 cups all-purpose flour
     
     1/2 teaspoon baking soda
     
     1/2 teaspoon salt
     
     1/3 cup well-shaken buttermilk
     
     1/2 teaspoon vanilla
     
     7 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
     
     1/2 cup granulated sugar
     
     1 large egg
     
     For icings
     
     2 3/4 cups confectioners sugar
     
     2 tablespoons light corn syrup
     
     2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
     
     1/2 teaspoon vanilla
     
     4 to 6 tablespoons water
     
     1/4 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder Special equipment: a small offset spatula
  
  + Make cookies: Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 350°F. Butter two large baking sheets. Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Stir together buttermilk and vanilla in a cup.
  
  + Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high until pale and fluffy -- about three minutes. Then add egg; beating until combined well. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture and buttermilk mixture alternately in batches, beginning and ending with flour mixture, and mixing just until smooth.
  
  + Drop rounded teaspoons of batter one inch apart onto baking sheets. Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until tops are puffed, edges are pale golden, and cookies spring back when touched: six to eight minutes total. Transfer to a rack to cool.
  
  + Make icings while cookies cool: Stir together confectioners sugar, corn syrup, lemon juice, vanilla, and two tablespoons water in a small bowl until smooth. If icing is not easily spreadable, add more water, a teaspoon at a time. Transfer half of icing to another bowl and stir in cocoa, adding more water, a teaspoon at a time, to thin to same consistency as vanilla icing. Cover surface with a dampened paper towel, then cover bowl with plastic wrap.
  
  + Ice cookies: With offset spatula, spread white icing over half of flat side of each cookie. Starting with cookies you iced first, spread chocolate icing over other half.
  
  + Cook's note: Once icing is dry, cookies keep layered between sheets of wax paper or parchment in an airtight container at room temperature for four days.

     Cookies
     1 3/4 	cups granulated sugar
     1/2 	lb unsalted butter, softened (2 sticks)          
     4 	large eggs
     1 	cup milk

     2 1/2 	cups cake flour
     2 1/2 	cups all-purpose flour
     1 	teaspoon baking powder

     Frosting
     4 	cups confectioners' sugar
     1/3-1/2 	cup boiling water
     1 	ounce bittersweet chocolate
     
  
   + Preheat the oven to 375.
   + Butter two baking sheets and set aside.
   + To make the cookies: In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar and butter.
   + Mix with mixer or hand until fluffy.
   + Add the eggs, milk, and vanilla and lemon extracts and mix until smooth.
   + In a medium bowl, combine the flours, baking powder, and salt and stir until mixed.
   + Add the dry ingredients to the wet in batches, stirring well to combine.
   + Using a soup spoon or ice cream scoop, drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
   +  Bake until the edges begin to brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
   + Allow to cool completely.
   + To make the frosting: Place the confectioners' sugar in a large bowl.
   +  Gradually add enough of the boiling water to the sugar, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick and spreadable.
   + Remove half of the frosting to the top half of a double boiler set over simmering water and add the chocolate.
   + Warm the mixture, stirring, until the chocolate is melted and the frosting is smooth.
   + Remove from the heat.
   + With a brush, coat half the cookie with chocolate frosting and the other half with white frosting.
   + ice on flat side.
  
  notes from postings- I had to add more chocolate and adding more powdered sugar was not a fix. The next time, I'm adding milk instead of boiling water to get a harder and higher gloss finish. The cookie alone was great.
  
  A way to keep the icing shiny is to add about a teaspoon of oil ( not olive oil) to the icing and it will be shiny. I do this when I make the lemon drop cookies. I'm from Syracuse, NY and I love these black and white cookies. We call them half-moons in Syracuse.. I live in Georgia now and Publix grocery stores make them. I use to work there in the bakery, and they are delicious.

# cookies- macaroons
  
  Macaroons must be baked on parchment paper. They will stick to an ungreased sheet and spread on a greased one. You need a slightly less stiff dough if piping the macaroons, so add water, as needed, to make a pipeable paste.
     
     INGREDIENTS
     14 ounces flaked, sweetened coconut 
     1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 
     1/3 cup large egg whites , plus 1 tablespoon, from about 3 large eggs
     1/2 teaspoon almond extract 
  
  + Set racks in upper-middle and lower-middle levels of oven and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line two large cookie sheets with parchment paper.
  + Turn coconut into food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade; process 1 minute. Add sugar, process 15 seconds longer. Add egg whites and extract; process 1 full minute until the paste resembles slushy snow. Scrape sides and corners of workbowl with spatula; process until stiff but cohesive, malleable paste (similar in consistency to marzipan or pasta dough) forms, about 5 seconds longer. If mixture is crumbly or dry, turn machine back on and add water by drops through feeder tube until proper consistency is reached.
  + Allowing scant 2 tablespoons of paste for each macaroon, form a dozen cookies upon each paper-lined sheet, spacing the cookies 1 1/2 inches apart. You can drop the paste from a spoon or for a neater look, roll it into 1-inch balls between your palms . (Rinse and dry your hands if they become too sticky.) To make fancy macaroons, pipe the paste using a large pastry bag fitted with a 3/4-inch open star tip.
  + Bake macaroons, switching cookie sheet positions midway through baking, until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. If overbaked, macaroons will dry out rather quickly when stored. Leave macaroons on papers until completely cooled or else they may tear. (Can be stored in an airtight container for at least 4 days or frozen up to 1 month.)
  
  
  
  fOR PINE NUT-CRUSTED ALMOND MACAROONS: 
  
  + Dip each ball into beaten egg white, then roll the balls in pine nuts, lightly pressing with your fingertips to adhere the nuts.
  
 + Transfer the nut-covered balls to the baking sheet and flatten them slightly with your fingers, making inch-wide buttons.

  + turn coconut into food processor firred with the metal shoing blade- process 1 minute.  add sugar adnd prrocess 15 seconds.  add egg whites and extract;  process 1 full minute until the paste resembles slushy snow.  scrape sides and corners of workbowl with spatula; process until stiff but cohesive, maleable paste (similiar in consistency to marzipan or pasta dough). forms, about 5 seconds longer.  if mixture is dry or crumbly turn machine on and add water by drops through feeder tube until proper conseistency is reached.
  
  + allowing scant 2 tablespoons of paste for each macaroon, form a dozen cookies upon each paper lined sheet, spacing the cookies 1 1/2 apart.  you can drop the paste from a spoon or for a neater look, roll it into 1 inch balls between your palms.  (rinse hands is they become too sticky).  to make fancy cookies, pipe the paste using a large pastry bag filled with 3/4 inch open star tuip.
  
  + bake cookies, switching cookie sheet positions midwat through baking until golden brown, 20-25 minutes.   if overbaked, macaroons will dry out rather quickly when stored.  leave macaroons on papers until completely cool3d or else they may tear.  (can be stored in an airtight container for at least 4 days or frozen up to one month.)

### cooks illustrated
  Though you can make one large creme caramel, we find that custards baked in individual ramekins cook faster, are more evenly textured, and unmold more easily. You can vary the amount of sugar in the custard to suit your taste. Most tasters preferred the full two-thirds cup, but you can reduce that amount to as little as one-half cup to create a greater contrast between the custard and the sweetness of the caramel. Cook the caramel in a pan with a light-colored interior, since a dark surface makes it difficult to judge the color of the syrup. Caramel can leave a real mess in a pan, but it is easy to clean. Simply boil lots of water in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes to loosen the hardened caramel.
   
  
     Caramel
     1 cup granulated sugar 
     1/3 cup water 
     2 tablespoons corn syrup 
     1/4 teaspoon lemon juice 
     
     Custard
     1 1/2 cups whole milk 
     1 1/2 cups light cream 
     3 large eggs 
     2 large egg yolks 
     2/3 cup granulated sugar 
     1 1/2 teaspoons     vanilla extract 
     	Pinch table salt 
  
  See Illustrations Below: Procedures for Crème Caramel
  
  1. For the caramel: In a medium nonreactive saucepan and without stirring, bring sugar, water, corn syrup, and lemon juice to simmer over medium-high heat, wiping sides of pan with wet cloth to remove any sugar crystals that might cause syrup to turn grainy. Continue to cook until syrup turns from clear to golden, swirling pan gently to ensure even browning, about 8 minutes. Continue to cook, swirling pan gently and constantly, until large, slow bubbles on mixture's surface turn honey-caramel in color, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Remove pan immediately from heat and, working quickly but carefully (the caramel is over 300 degrees and will burn you if it touches your skin), pour a portion of the caramel into each of 8 ungreased 6-ounce ovenproof ramekins. Allow caramel to cool and harden, about 15 minutes. (Can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 2 days; return to room temperature before adding custard.)
  2. For the custard: Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Heat milk and cream, stirring occasionally, in medium saucepan over medium heat until steam appears and/or an instant-read thermometer held in the liquid registers 160 degrees, 6 to 8 minutes; remove from heat. Meanwhile, gently whisk eggs, yolks, and sugar in large bowl until just combined. Off heat, gently whisk warm milk mixture, salt, and vanilla into eggs until just combined but not at all foamy. Strain mixture through fine mesh sieve into large measuring cup or container with pouring spout; set aside.
  3. Bring 2 quarts water to boil in kettle. Meanwhile, fold dish towel to fit bottom of large baking dish or roasting pan and position in pan. Divide reserved custard mixture among ramekins; place filled ramekins on towel in pan (making sure they do not touch) and set pan on oven rack. Fill pan with boiling water to reach halfway up ramekins; cover entire pan loosely with aluminum foil so steam can escape. Bake until a paring knife inserted halfway between center and edge of the custards comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer custards to wire rack; cool to room temperature (Can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to 2 days.)
  4. To unmold, slide a paring knife around entire mold perimeter, pressing knife against side of the dish. Hold serving plate over top of ramekin and invert; set plate on work surface and shake ramekin gently to release custard. Serve immediately.
  For one large crème caramel: Follow recipe for Classic Crème Caramel, pouring caramel and custard into 1 1/2-quart straight-sided soufflé dish rather than individual ramekins. Fill roasting pan with boiling water to reach halfway up sides of soufflé dish; increase baking time to 70 to 75 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in center of custard registers 175 degrees.

  MAKES ONE CAKE
   
      
      	For the Meringue:
     18 large egg whites, at room temperature 
     1/4 teaspoon salt 
     1 teaspoon cream of tartar 
     1 cup, plus 2 tablespoons sugar 
     1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
      	
     		Nonstick cooking spray
      
      	For the Crème Anglaise:
     4 cups half-and-half 
     12 large egg yolks 
     1 cup sugar 
     1 tablespoon, plus 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
      
      For the Caramel Sauce:
     1 cup sugar
     
   
  + Prepare the Meringue; Preheat oven to 325° with rack in center. Fill a large roasting pan halfway with water and transfer to oven.
   
  + In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, slowly whisk whites and salt until slightly foamy. Add cream of tartar, and gradually increase the speed to high. Add sugar, one tablespoon at a time, until meringue is stiff; lower speed and add vanilla, whisking until combined.
   
 + Spray a 10-inch (15 cup) nonstick angel food-cake pan without a removable bottom using nonstick cooking spray; transfer meringue to pan. Using a rubber spatula, firmly press down on meringue to remove any air pockets, and to smooth the surface.
   
  + Transfer to prepared roasting pan. Bake until lightly golden and puffed, 45 to 55 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, and cool completely; meringue will deflate as it cools. Invert into a shallow serving bowl, and chill until ready to serve.
   
    + Prepare the Crème Anglaise; Prepare an ice-water bath; set aside. In a medium saucepan, heat cream over medium heat until just beginning to steam, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, whisk together yolks and sugar in a large bowl until smooth. While whisking constantly, slowly add 1/4 of the heated cream to yolk mixture, being careful not to cook the yolks. When thoroughly combined, slowly add remaining cream. Transfer yolk mixture back into same saucepan, and set over low heat, stirring and scraping down the sides of the pan with a small heatproof spatula until thickened. Strain crème anglaise through a fine sieve into bowl set in the prepared ice bath. Stir in vanilla. Chill until ready to serve.
   
 + Prepare the Caramel Syrup; Combine sugar and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Do not stir or allow to boil until sugar is completely dissolved; gently swirl or tilt saucepan to help dissolve. Bring syrup to a boil by increasing to high heat; cook, covered, for 2 minutes. Uncover, and continue to boil untouched until caramel begins to darken; swirl until syrup becomes a dark amber color. Remove from heat, and immediately add 1/3 cup water, being careful to stand back. Swirl until smooth and let cool; chill until ready to serve.
   
  + When ready to serve, pour enough crème anglaise around meringue to come one-third of the way up the sides. Drizzle meringue with caramel syrup; serve immediately.

     6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) butter, melted, divided
     
     1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
     
     1/2 cup chopped pecans
     
     1 package (15 ounces) folded refrigerated pie crusts
     
     1 cup granulated sugar
     
     1/3 cup all-purpose flour
     
     3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
     
     5 large Granny Smith or other firm apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch wedges
  
  DIRECTIONS:
  
  1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Coat a deep-dish pie plate with nonstick cooking spray and line it with waxed paper. Coat the waxed paper with cooking spray. 
  2. In a small bowl, combine 4 tablespoons butter, the brown sugar, and pecans; mix well and spread evenly over the bottom of the pie plate. Unfold 1 pie crust and place it in the pie plate, pressing the crust firmly against the nut mixture and the sides of the plate; set aside. 
  3. In a large bowl, combine the granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter; mix well. Add the apples and toss gently to coat. Spoon into the pie crust. 
  4. Unfold the second pie crust and place over the apple mixture. Trim and fold the edges together to seal. Using a knife, cut four 1-inch slits in the top crust. 
  5. Bake for 1 to 1-1/4 hours, or until the crust is golden. Carefully loosen the waxed paper around the rim and invert the pie onto a serving plate while still hot. Remove the waxed paper and allow to cool slightly, then cut into wedges and serve warm, or allow to cool completely before serving. 
  
  
  Preparation tip: To make sure you don't have to do any oven cleanup, position a cookie sheet on the bottom oven rack to catch any juices that may leak from the pie while it's baking.

# honey babecue sauce from applebees
  Menu Description: "Flame-grilled Atlantic Salmon with Applebee's Honey Pepper Sauce served with a side of almond rice pilaf, seasoned vegetables and toasted garlic bread."
  
     Honey Pepper Sauce
     3/4 cup honey 
     1/3 cup soy sauce 
     1/4 cup dark brown sugar, packed 
     1/4 cup pineapple juice 
     juice of 1 lemon (about 2 tablespoons)
     2 tablespoons white distilled vinegar 
     2 teaspoons olive oil 
     1 teaspoon ground black pepper 
     1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
     1/2 teaspoon paprika 
     1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 
  
     4 8-ounce salmon fillets (without skin)    
  
  1. Make the sauce by combining all ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium/low heat. Stir occasionally until sauce begins to boil, then simmer uncovered for 15 minutes or until syrupy. Watch the sauce closely to be sure it doesn't bubble over.
  2. Preheat barbecue grill to medium heat. Rub each salmon filet with vegetable oil, then add a light sprinkling of salt and pepper. Grill the salmon for 4 to 7 minutes per side or until done. Serve salmon with a small cup of the honey pepper sauce on the side. (http://www.topsecretrecipes.com)
  
    It's all about the sauce with this one. This sweet, tangy and slightly spicy sauce goes perfectly with salmon, but can also be used on chicken or ribs. Just be sure to watch the sauce closely as it cooks in case it starts to bubble over. It's gonna get thicker as it cools, so be sure not to overcook it. If it becomes too thick, just add a bit of water to thin it out. And if you want to serve the salmon with an amazing, easy-to-make almond rice pilaf as they do in the restaurant, check in right here next week. 

# hummus
  ok, ok, here it is and i hope its good. this is a tricky recipe to get just 
  right.
     
     16 oz tahini
     1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
     3 medium cloves garlic
     1 teaspoon salt
     10 shakes of tobasco sauce (more if you use the green tobasco)
     1 1/2 cups hot water
     3 cans (14-16 oz) garbanza beans, drained and rinsed (or great northern, 
     black beans...)
     optional- olives, olive tepanade, roasted red pepers, etc.
  
  + put tahini, lemon juice, garlic, salt, tobasco, and 1 cup hot water in food processor and process. add the 1/2 cup of water if the mixture gets too thick (i think the amount of water needed is brand specific). scrape down 
  sides of bowl and process. add garbanza beans and process.
  
  notes: the best brand of tahini has arabic writing on the label ('lebanon valley' in a white plastic bottle) and is sold at uncle tom's (really- i kid you not) in spring hill but be forwarned- he isn't always open. he also has 
  the best real thin bread.
  
  a great sandwich is hummus and feta with greens, tomato, etc. yummmmm.

# pancake, german apple
  German Apple Pancake
  1/2003
  
  A 10-inch ovenproof skillet is necessary for this recipe; we highly recommend using a nonstick skillet for the sake of easy cleanup, but a regular skillet will work as well. You can also use a cast-iron pan; if you do, set the oven temperature to 425 degrees in step 1, and when cooking the apples in step 3, cook them only until just barely golden, about 6 minutes. Cast iron retains heat better than stainless steel, making the higher oven temperature unnecessary. If you prefer tart apples, use Granny Smiths; if you prefer sweet ones, use Braeburns. For serving, dust the apple pancake with confectioners' sugar and pass warm maple syrup or caramel sauce (recipe linked) separately, if desired.
  
     Serves 4
     1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour (2 1/2 ounces)
     1 tablespoon granulated sugar 
     1/2 teaspoon table salt 
     2 large eggs 
     2/3 cup half-and-half 
     1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
     2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
     1 1/4 pounds Granny Smith apples or Braeburn apples (3 to 4 large apples), peeled, quartered, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
     1/4 cup light brown sugar or dark brown sugar
     1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
     1 teaspoon lemon juice 
     	confectioners' sugar for dusting
  
  
  1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position; heat oven to 500 degrees.
  
  2. Whisk to combine flour, granulated sugar, and salt in medium bowl. In second medium bowl, whisk eggs, half-and-half, and vanilla until combined. Add liquid ingredients to dry and whisk until no lumps remain, about 20 seconds; set batter aside.
  
  3. Heat butter in 10-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until sizzling. Add apples, brown sugar, and cinnamon; cook, stirring frequently with heatproof rubber spatula, until apples are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in lemon juice.
  
  4. Working quickly, pour batter around and over apples (see illustration 1 from "Step by Step: Preparing the Pancake). Place skillet in oven and immediately reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees; bake until pancake edges are brown and puffy and have risen above edges of skillet, about 18 minutes.
  
  5. Using oven mitts to protect hands, remove hot skillet from oven and loosen pancake edges with heatproof rubber spatula; invert pancake onto serving platter (see illustrations 2 and 3 from "Step by Step: Preparing the Pancake"). Dust with confectioners' sugar, cut into wedges, and serve.

  1. Lightly coat 9-inch Pyrex pie plate with cooking spray. Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in bowl.
  
  2. With electric mixer at medium-high speed, beat butter and cream cheese in large bowl, stopping once or twice to scrape down beater and sides of bowl, until completely homogenous, about 2 minutes. Add flour mixture and combine on medium-low until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 20 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl. Increase mixer speed to medium-high and beat until dough begins to form large clumps, about 30 seconds. Reserve 3 tablespoons of dough. Turn remaining dough onto lightly floured surface, gather into ball, and flatten into 6-inch disk. Transfer disk to greased pie plate.

# pumpkin cheesecake
  
  Top Secret Recipes version of The Cheesecake Factory Pumpkin Cheesecake by Todd Wilbur 	

     1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
     5 tablespoons butter, melted
     1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
     3 8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened
     1 teaspoon vanilla
     1 cup canned pumpkin
     3 eggs
     1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
     1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
     1/4 teaspoon allspice
     whipped cream 
  
  1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. Make the crust by combining the graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter and 1 tablespoon sugar in a medium bowl. Stir well enough to coat all of the crumbs with the butter, but not so much as to turn the mixture into paste. Keep it crumbly.
  3. Press the crumbs onto the bottom and about two-thirds of the way up the sides of the springform pan. You don't want the crust to form all of the way up the back of each slice of cheesecake. Bake the crust for 5 minutes, then set it aside until you are ready to fill it.
  4. In a large mixing bowl combine the cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, and vanilla. Mix with an electric mixer until smooth.
  5. Add the pumpkin, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice and continue to beat until smooth and creamy.
  6. Pour the filling into the pan. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes. The top will turn a bit darker at this point. Remove from the oven and allow the cheesecake to cool.
  7. When the cheesecake has come to room temperature, put it into the refrigerator. When the cheesecake has chilled, remove the pan sides and cut the cake into 8 equal pieces. Serve with a generous portion of whipped cream on top.

  
  Serves 8.

# soup= avgolemono chicken/lemon
  Greek Egg-Lemon Soup-Avgolemono
  Published: March 1, 2000
  Makes about 8 cups, serving 6 to 8
  
  Homemade chicken stock gives this soup the best flavor and body; in a pinch, use low-sodium canned chicken broth. The longer the final soup cooks after the eggs have been added, the thicker it becomes. About 5 minutes of heating produces a soft, velvety texture; any longer and the soup begins to turn pasty. Scallions and fresh mint, individually or together, make simple and flavorful garnishes. Serve the soup immediately; it thickens to a gravylike consistency when reheated.
  
    
    2 quarts chicken stock, preferably homemade (see related recipe)
    1/2 cup long grain white rice 
    1 bay leaf 
    4 green cardamom pods , crushed, or 2 whole cloves
    12 lemon zest strips , about 1-inch x 4-inch pieces), from 1 1/2 medium lemons (see illustration below)
    1 1/2 teaspoons    table salt 
    2 large eggs , preferably at room temperature
    2 large egg yolks , preferably at room temperature
    1/4 cup    lemon juice from zested lemons
    1 large scallion , sliced thin, and/or 3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves
    Large Strips of Zest
  
  + Bring chicken stock to boil in medium nonreactive saucepan over high heat. Add rice, bay leaf, cloves or cardamom, lemon zest, and salt; reduce heat to medium and simmer until rice is tender and stock is aromatic from lemon zest, 16 to 20 minutes. With slotted spoon, remove and discard bay leaf, cloves or cardamom, and zest strips; increase heat to high and return stock to boil, then reduce heat to low.
  + Whisk eggs, yolks, and lemon juice lightly in medium nonreactive bowl until combined. Whisking constantly, slowly ladle about 2 cups hot stock into egg mixture; whisk until combined. Pour egg-stock mixture back into saucepan; cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until soup is slightly thickened and wisps of steam appear, 4 to 5 minutes. Do not simmer or boil. Divide soup among serving bowls, sprinkle with scallion and/or mint; serve immediately.
  
  i made this with chicken base and it was great.  also used  ground cardamon and a pinch of cayenne.
  
  optional cinnamon maybe sans cardamon.

# zuchini fritters
  Be sure to squeeze the zucchini until it is completely dry, or the fritters will fall apart in the skillet. Don't let the squeeze-dried zucchini sit on its own for too long or it will brown. These fritters are great warm or at room temperature, and can be served as a side dish or as a meze with cocktails. Serve with Tzatziki Sauce (see related recipe) or plain with lemon wedges. This recipe is from The Best International Recipe.
  
  
    1 pound zucchini (about 2 medium), trimmed
    1 teaspoon table salt 
    8 ounces feta cheese , crumbled (about 2 cups)
    2 scallions, minced
    2 tablespoons minced fresh dill 
    2 large eggs, lightly beaten
    1 medium garlic clove, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
    1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 
    1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour 
    6 tablespoons olive oil 
    1 lemon, cut into wedges (for serving)
  
  To Shred Zucchini for Sautéing or Pan-Fying
  
  + Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 200 degrees. Following the illustration below, shred the zucchini on the large holes of a box grater or in a food processor fitted with the shredding disk. Toss the shredded zucchini with the salt and let it drain in a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl for 10 minutes. Wrap the zucchini in paper towels and squeeze out the excess liquid.
  + Combine the dried zucchini, feta, scallions, dill, eggs, garlic, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir until uniformly incorporated.
  + Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Drop 2-tablespoon-sized portions of the batter into the pan, then use the back of a spoon to press the batter into 2-inch-wide fritters (you should fit about 6 fritters in the pan at a time). Fry until golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
  + Transfer the fritters to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm. Wipe the skillet clean with paper towels. Return the skillet to medium-high heat, add the remaining 3 tablespoons oil, and repeat with the remaining batter. Serve warm or at room temperature with the lemon wedges.
